# Description

The [Speculation Rules API](https://github.com/WICG/nav-speculation/blob/main/triggers.md#speculation-rules) is a JSON-defined API developed by Google to enhance the performance of web page loading through speculative loading strategies.

### How Does It Work?
Google's Speculation Rules API is designed to target document URLs rather than specific resource files. The Speculation Rules API introduces a more expressive and configurable syntax for specifying which documents should be prefetched or prerendered.
With a structure defined in JSON format within a script `type="speculationrules"`, developers can articulate rules for both prerendering and prefetching. This enhanced flexibility allows for fine-tuning speculative loading.
